How to run:
    Open a terminal in my project folder.
    Run "mkdir build" to create a build folder.
    Run "cd build" to go into the build folder.
    Run "cmake .." to set up the project.
    Run "make" to build the program.
    Run the built exe with ./list.exe
    To run tests based on the files you passed, run the exe file with a passed arg of the absolote path of the problem file to test.
    example, ./list.exe "C:\user\blah\blah\test-1000-problem"


exercise 1:
    Implement a binary tree and provide all of the dynamic set operations (as listed in the CLRS3 book on page 230, or CLRS4 page 250).
    Add functions to compute the depth and size of a tree.
    Write tests for each operation to demonstrate how it works, and also to try to find errors in it.
    Use your binary tree implementation to realize an algorithm that, given a set of numbers, prints them out in sorted order.

    asnwer:
        See b-tree for function implementations & see main.c for tests.

exercise 2:

    Test the program on the sorting problems provided with lab 2:

    1. Use the load file function to load one of the provided unsorted files into an array

    2. Create a binary tree containing all the numbers in the array

    3. Print all numbers in sorted order

        See createTreeFromArray in "b-tree.h".
